Information about an exe file:
* Source: Crackmes.de
* Program: 5min.exe
* Platform: Windows
* Level: 1
* Tools: x64dbg, Ghidra and HxD

## A little theory
* The instruction pointer is stored in the EIP register.
* FLAGS is used to store information about the status of arithmetic operations and other system status information. For example, if 0 was obtained as a result of an earlier adding operation, the ZF flag (zero flags - applies to the previous operation) will be assigned the value 1. Flags saved in the FLAGS register are used mainly to implement conditional branches.
* CR0 - decide to enable paging.
* CR2 - contains the address of the missing page.
* CR3 - base address of the paged data structure.
* CR4 - hardware virtualization settings.
* DR0-DR7 - are used to specify the memory pause point. They are used for debugging, but the system allows you to specify only four memory break points (DR0-DR3). Others are used to store status information.
* The instruction MOV data is used to transfer data, which is also often used to transfer data stored in memory and to save data in memory. Access to memory is done using square brackets. <i>Attention</i>, square brackets in the LEA instruction have a different meaning. Well, Load Effective Address will save the address, not the value in the destination registry.

## Analysis
The first action is throwing the exe file to Ghidra.

![pe](/img/writeupCrackMeDE5min/pe.png)

* Headers - there are some informations, e.g. on compatibility, etc.
* .text - contains instructions that the processor will execute. This is the only fragment that is executed and contains code.
* .rdata - this is a read-only section, contains constants and "debug information".
* .data - variables are stored here, except for automatic variables that are placed on the stack. Here are mainly global variables.
* .rsrc - these are information about the resources used by the program, e.g. icons, pictures etc.

In the image below we see that on lines 12-39 we have a lot of IFs that are responsible for the logic of the main window. The function in line 32 is interesting **FUN_004010F5**.

![entry](/img/writeupCrackMeDE5min/entry.png)

![while](/img/writeupCrackMeDE5min/while.png)

The address 00401105 is interesting, which is CMPSB (Compare String Operands). As we can find out, it's about _"Compares byte at address DS:(E)SI with byte at address	ES:(E)DI and sets the status flags accordingly"_. In addition, the word **REPE** makes the processor compare chains until the (E) CX register is 0 or two non-matching elements are found. The program requires that the Name field have between 8 and 12 characters. After entering "TESTaaaa" (saved in 004030A0 address) and "SERIAL" (saved in 004030F0 address), notice that they appear before the loop (00401105). And knowing that the loop works on ESI and EDI registers, then the character strings with Name and Serial are compared. The value 13 is saved in ECX in 00401100.

![beforewhile](/img/writeupCrackMeDE5min/beforewhile.png)

If ECX is equal to 0, then a jump to 5min.4011BA will be made. After the jump, it is ordered to show that the specified series is incorrect. To sum up, the loop checks if 12 characters from the username are the same as the key. If so, an incorrect series message is displayed.

### EDIT
From 00401118 to 00401145 it has to check if the given name has between 8 and 12 characters. Additionally, does the given series have exactly 12 characters. This is achieved by means of _REPNE SCASB - SCAS = SCan A String; byte comparison; find EAX, starting at ES:[(E)DI]) scans the string searching for the first string element which is equal to the value in the accumulator and updates the status flags according to the results. The string element and register contents are not modified. It won't touch any registers other than ECX (counter) and EDI (address)_. During the search, ECX is reduced.

Observing what will happen if the jump instruction is not followed, we see a strange thing.

It has modifications to the code section in function **FUN_004010F5**.

![romodify](/img/writeupCrackMeDE5min/romodify.png)

In the rest of the function **FUN_004010F5** it can be see that the name must be between 8 and 12 characters, and the serial must be exactly 12 characters.

![checkNameSerial](/img/writeupCrackMeDE5min/checkNameSerial.png)

After a long analysis, the following fragment shows the algorithm of our program.

![alg](/img/writeupCrackMeDE5min/alg.png)

![algG](/img/writeupCrackMeDE5min/algG.png)

If EAX will be zero (at 0040118C jump if ZF set, and in 00401189 OR operation with the ZF flag set), then an error message about the serial is displayed. The transition to the display of the success message is under 0040118E. Aaaaa ..... WAIT! Here condition at 0040118C is modified by 2C75!

![hexwork](/img/writeupCrackMeDE5min/hexwork.png)

The solution is to modify this place (0040110F) in the binary and change 2C75 to 17EB (17 because 15 + JMP size (two-byte), 15 is taken from the instructions below). Then we will have JMP at 0040118C address, which will jump to the place where the success message will be displayed.

This particular fragment in Ghidra looks like this:

![algNG](/img/writeupCrackMeDE5min/algNG.png)

We can see that we have two loops. Small loop: 0040115A <-> 00401165 and large: 00401149 <-> 00401178. The fragment 00401189-0040118C is interesting. So, to display the success message is EAX == 0 (because 0040118C)! Hmm......

How the _parts_ of the registry works? Let's examine it based on EDX, where:

* DL is _least significant byte of DX_, otherwise e.g. the first 8 bits of the right 32-bit number.
* DH is _most significant byte of DX_.
* DX is _least significant byte of EDX_.

Well, if we have something like this _MOV EDX, 0x12345678_, that mean:

* EDX = 0x12345678
* DX = 0x5678
* DH = 0x56
* DL = 0x78

Then if we do something like that _MOV DL, 0x01_ that mean:

* EDX = 0x12345601
* DX = 0x5601
* DH = 0x56
* DL = 0x01

Back to _Hmm..._ ;) then we have to give input that it will be EAX = 0. And EAX consists of the value stored in DS. It would have to compare 00401178 DS == 0, then the large loop (00401182) will not repeat either. Before comparing, it has added the last character from Name to DS and then the XOR with the last character Serial. It would appear that Name and Serial should be identical, and before there is a condition checking if they are, if so, an error key message is printed! But if you could give 12 characters and Name and Serial were identical, then we go to the success message. After a long battle, it seems that:

* Name = 111111111111
* Serial = 111111141112

Why? Because the series must have exactly 12 characters, and the algorithm starts analyzing two strings from the end. To bypass the first protection, the last characters must be different. We are looking at a small loop 0040115A <-> 00401165.
