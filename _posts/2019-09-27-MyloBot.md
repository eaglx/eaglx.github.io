The malware was downloaded from the _GitHub_ repository [1]. Starting point MyloBota is a function WinMain, which is shown in the fig. 1. The malware needs Windows API functions, which are propably hashed - I'm not entirely sure. Coded functions shows fig. 2. Firstly are called _funGetHashedFunctionst_ and _funGetWinAPIfunAddr_. In function _funGetHashedFunctionst_ Windows API function names are coded and assigned to structure. In contrast, the function _funGetWinAPIfunAddr_ looks for the address of the desired function.

![1-0](/img/MalwMB/1-1.png)

Obtaining the address of a specific function Windows API relies (as researchers noted _Deep Instinct_[2] on searching the structure *_PEB_LDR_DATA* and *_LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY* [3]. The following code shows how MyloBot gets into the PEB structure. By referring to the registry FS:0x30 (Windos x64 to GS:0x60) we get the address of the PEB structure. Then adding 0x0C we get to _Ldr_. Adding 0x0C we get to _Ldr.InLoadOrderModuleList.Flink_.

{% highlight c++ %}
__asm
{
    mov eax, fs: [0x30]
    mov PEB, eax
}
Ldr = *((void**)((unsigned char*)PEB + 0x0c));
Flink = *((void**)((unsigned char*)Ldr + 0x0c));
p = Flink;
{% endhighlight %}

Further actions in the WinMain are just downloading the necessary function addresses Windows API. The full list of necessary functions below.

{% highlight AsciiDoc %}
+120h	CreateTimerQueue
+1A0h	WaitingForSingleObject
+88h	CreateEventA
+48h	RtlInitializeCriticalSection
+168h	SetUnhandledExceptionFilter
+1A4h	GetTicketCount
+1B8h	GetVersion
+7Ch	RtlEnterCriticalSection
+6Ch	CreateTimerQueueTimer
+110h	FindResourceA
+1A8h	LoadResource
+170h	SizeofResource
+74h	LockResource
+154h	4D4D5A00
+1C4h	pointer to first byte of the resource ex. 40D0A8
+10h	VirtualAlloc
+148h	address of the allocated region (1D0000)
+10Ch	019440
+150h	InterLockedDecrement
{% endhighlight %}

At the end of WinMain, a critical section is created using the function _RtlInitializeCriticalSection_. Next an exception handler is created by calling _SetUnHandledExceptionFilter_ with a parameter to the function shown in the figure 3. In the function we have two key variables vDivZero and vCounter, which will be discussed later.

![3-1](/img/MalwMB/3-1.png)

Additionally in WinMain by calling _CreateTimerQueueTimer_ (fig. 4) a timer is created with a parameter to the function (also called callback function) _funDivZeroAndCriticalSection_. Finally _WaitingForSingleObject_ is called. After a certain time, a new thread is created (threads are created constantly) which starts executing _funDivZeroAndCriticalSection_.

![4-1](/img/MalwMB/4-1.png)

Each newly created thread performs a function, which contains a critical section. The important fact is this, that before entering the critical section zero division takes place (fig. 5). The variable used for this is vDivZero, which has a value 0 assigned. It is changed by function (fig. 3), which runs when an exception occurs (assigns the value 1 to the variable vDiveZero). This is an anti-debugging mechanism. If the program is debugged, this exception will not be handled by MyloBota. Then we have a function call _RtlEnterCriticalSection_. Any other thread will stop before this function and wait for _RtlLeaveCriticalSection_ to be called, which is not called anywhere. Thanks to this, malware can be sure, that only one thread will follow further instructions. Next MyloBot extracts the code from the resource section, which is encrypted. Researchers from _Deep Instinct_ indicate the use of the algorithm RC4, the key is stored in the resource header [2].

![5-1](/img/MalwMB/5-1.png)

Before switching to the previously extracted code and decrypting the instructions there is a second anti-debugging mechanism. It is shown in the figure 6. Variable vCounter is vital (here the thread waits until a certain value is reached), and it is modified in the exception handler (fig. 3). There vCounter is incremented by 1.

![7-1](/img/MalwMB/7-1.png)

Instructions (also called shellcode), which has been loaded and launched from the resource section, first get the necessary Windows API functions (fig. 7). At the beginning PEB structure is searched to get the _kernel32.dll_ address. The following functions are imported from the library [2]:
* GetExitCodeProcess
* WaitForSingeObject
* ExitProcess
* ReadProcessMemory
* GetModuleFileName
* CreateProcess
* GetCommandLine
* GetThreadContext
* VirtualAllocEx
* WriteProcessMemory
* SetThreadContext
* ResumeThread
* VirtualFree
* GetModuleHandle

![7-2-1](/img/MalwMB/7-2-1.png)

After downloading the addresses of the necessary Windows API functions, the transition to the second layer begins. The first step is to create the suspended process by calling _CreateProcessW_ (argument 80000004h == CREATE_SUSPEND | CREATE_NO_WINDOW) (fig. 8). MyloBot operates on the same executable file.

![7-3-1](/img/MalwMB/7-3-1.png)

Observations show that MyloBot modifies Entry Point process. Default (let's say) Entry Point file is _4025D0_, which can be located in the debugger (fig. 9). In short, you can outline the process to the steps described below.

1. Create suspended process.
2. Call NtUnmapViewOfSection to copy code from shellcode's resources.
3. Call GetThreadContext to get CONTEXT structure.
4. SetThreadContext with modified entry point.
5. Call ResumeThread.

![7-3-3-2](/img/MalwMB/7-3-3-2.png)

Figure 10 shows how the CONTEXT internal structure looks and how the entry point is modified. Old entry point 4025D0 (bottom debugger dump) is converted to 40258F (top debugger dump).

![7-3-3-3](/img/MalwMB/7-3-3-3.png)

Before allowing MyloBot to call functions _ResumeThread_ it is worth to modify the suspended process to be able to switch the debugger to him. The program was used in the analysis _Process Hacker_. Figure 11 shows at which address the entry point will be searched.

![7-3-3-4](/img/MalwMB/7-3-3-4.png)

Since we know that the new Entry Point is 40258F, we can quickly jump over the appropriate offset _0x0258F_ (fig. 12).

![7-3-3-5](/img/MalwMB/7-3-3-5.png)

In Figure 13 we see the entry point found that begins with the instruction: 55 6B.

![7-3-3-6](/img/MalwMB/7-3-3-6.png)

We remember the previous code (it is 55 6B) and modify the entry point so the process after resuming begins to perform infinite loops. To do this, we enter the instructions: EB FF (fig. 14). It is simply _jmp 1_.

![7-3-3-7](/img/MalwMB/7-3-3-7.png)

t the beginning of the second layer, the necessary Windows API functions are imported. As in the first layer, the functions are encoded in the form of hash function values (fig. 15). Decoding is shown in Figure 16. To decode a character string which conceals the Windows API function name just the operation XOR is made on each byte of the name. Below there is the code in the language _Python 3_, which decodes function names and a full list of hidden DLL names and Windows API function names.

In the second layer there are a lot of anti-vm and anti-debugging mechanisms (fig. 17). First, the executable name is checked using the function _StrStrW_ (fig. 18). It does not contain a chain "SAMPLE", "VIRUS" or "SANDBOX". Similarly the computer name is checked.

![9-2](/img/MalwMB/9-2.png)

It is checked whether the _OllyDbg's dbghelp.dll_ has been loaded (fig. 19). Malware checks it by calling _GetModuleHandleA_ with a the library as a parameter in his process.

![9-3](/img/MalwMB/9-3.png)

It is checked whether the malware works in the program _Wine_ (fig. 20). It checks this by searching in the library _kernel32.dll_ function address _wine_get_unix_file_name_. It is interesting to use the program Wine for malware analysis. It is described well by [8].

![9-4](/img/MalwMB/9-4.png)

Checks if the malware has been launched inside VirtualBox (fig. 21). It verifies this by checking if a file exists in the location _C:\Windows\System32\drivers\VBoxMouse.sys_.

![9-5](/img/MalwMB/9-5.png)

Another funny technique (fig. 22) use instruction CPUID, which provides, among other things, information about the processor. Instruction CPUID was used with EAX set to 1. The 31th bit in the register ECX is important. If the value 1 is there, it means that MyloBot works under a virtual machine.

![9-6-1](/img/MalwMB/9-6-1.png)

In the case of a program VirtualBox effective solution against instructions CPUID is turning off acceleration (fig. 23).

![9-6-2](/img/MalwMB/9-6-2.png)

A short experiment was carried out to check the effectiveness of hide virtual machine. There were used VirtualBox in version 5.2.32 and G++ 8.1.0 (fig. 24 and 25). Two tests were carried out. In the first test CPUID is executed with EAX set to 1. In the second EAX is set to 0x40000000. In the first test the 31th bit in the register ECX is set to 1. After turning off acccleration it is 0. In the second test, we get characters that are unique to a given virtual machine. In case of VirtualBox it is 2020557398. After turning off acccleration (fig. 25) it can see that instruction CPUID does not allow to identify VirtualBox.

![9-6-3](/img/MalwMB/9-6-3.png)

![9-6-4](/img/MalwMB/9-6-4.png)

The last three techniques relate to virtual machine detection, precisely VMware. Generally these techniques are about reading information from e.g. Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) (instruction SIDT), which tells where the interrupt handles are located in memory. In addition, other tables include Global Descriptor Table (GDT) (instruction SLDT) and Local Descriptor Table (LDT) (instruction SGDT) [4]. First method (fig. 26) uses instructions SIDT (other name The Red Pill). The instruction can be executed in user mode. Those are the extracted data from IDT and saved to the place specified by the programmer. The address is checked IDT by moving about offset 2. In the software VMware it is a value 0FF00000h [4][5].

![9-7-1](/img/MalwMB/9-7-1.png)

Second technique (fig. 27 and 28) bases on the instruction SLDT. First some data is saved to a specific place, in case of MyloBota it is DEADBEEF. Execution of the instruction SLDT indicating that information from LDT causes saving that information in the same place as the value  DEADBEEF. If the malware works under VMWare value DEADBEEF will be modified [6].

![9-7-2-1](/img/MalwMB/9-7-2-1.png)

![9-7-2-2](/img/MalwMB/9-7-2-2.png)

Third technique (fig. 29) uses instructions SGDT. It is similar to the first technique [7].

![9-7-3](/img/MalwMB/9-7-3.png)

Then it is checked whether MyloBot has been started with the parameter "wusaupdate" (fig. 30). Arguments are retrieved using GetCommandLineA. If the malware was launched with the parameter "wusaupdate" then the Windows Update (function funDisableUpdate_Defender) and Windows Defender are shut down. In addition rules will be added to the Windows firewall (function funAddRulesToFirewall). The rules apply to blocking specific ports.

![10-1](/img/MalwMB/10-1.png)

By calling ShellExecuteA the Windows Update is disabled (with parameters e.g. /C sc stop wuauserv) (fig. 31 and 32). Windows Defender is disabled when the key in the registry is modified (fig. 32).

![10-2](/img/MalwMB/10-2.png)

![10-2-1](/img/MalwMB/10-2-1.png)

Adding rules to Windows Firewall is done by calling ShellExecuteA with parameter /C netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="blockport %d" dir=ou" where %d will be converted to specific port (fig. 33).

![10-3](/img/MalwMB/10-3.png)

At the beginning of the third layer (fig. 34) a mutex _aHyceyeoh7efhs_ is created. Next MyloBot creates a lot of threads. All this is very well described in the report [2].
